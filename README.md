# Udacity_Cpp_Revisited

Trying to redo the exercises on the Udacity's C++ Course (link[https://learn.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd213])

Attempting to improve on these exercises and projects by:
- Adding better descriptions
- Adding GTests when appropriate
- Attempting to use Copilot as much as possible, and commenting on that
